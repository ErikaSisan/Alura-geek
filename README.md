# alura-geek

E-commerce page for an online store for geek products which will be developed as result of a Front-End Challenge (3rd edition) exclusively for students of Alura Tech School.

The Challenge simulates a real work environment, with tasks required by the designers via Trello cards so students may experience how a real job feels like. It's necessary to communicate and understand what the designers really want from each taks, we can choose the technology that best apply for us to develop the code. You can add features and suggest modifications in case you have better ideas and so on.

There are no specific classes for the challenge, so we must go on with the knowledge we have. The instructors have prepared a study plan with tips of things we might need in case we need to do something and don't know exactly how to do it, but it's our part to seek and exchange info with other developers to get the job done.

The Challenge lasts 4 weeks. Every Monday for 3 weeks we'll receive new assignments from the designers and should develop what was asked. On week 4 we are free to implement new features or play with styles and othe appearances feats.

The Challenge starts at March, 14th.
